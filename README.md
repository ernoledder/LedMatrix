# LedMatrix

I used code from this source: https://github.com/jeffkub/led-wall-clock

To send an image to the LED-matrix look at client.py and change it accordingly.
To send text to the LED-matrix enter this in your commandline (linux and mac only): telnet 131.174.106.195 5800

Talk.py is the socket end of the raspberry pi
dimmer and display are altered from the original so take a look at those if you want to make somehting like this yourself.
